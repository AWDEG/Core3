# Afterlife SWG: Based on SWGEmu Core3 / Engine3, and on Levarris Hawk's work in Stardust SWG #

## Afterlife SWG ##

Afterlife is a take on Pre-NGE Star Wars Galaxies with a primary focus on combat balance, quick, fast paced combat, challenging gameplay, crafting, and an overall content experience that you will not get anywhere else.

If you are tired of servers that cater to people that whine for an easy mode experience, watering down essential components of the game in the name of “Quality of Life”,  you may have come to the right place.

## Why do we share ALL of our Source? ##

Aside from the terms of the AGPL Licensing, it is our philosophy that good work should be shared.

## Additional dependencies ##

This modified Core3 Repository utilizes the ModTheGalaxy Client TRE Files instead of the stock TRE Files included with the retail client. The ModTheGalaxy TRE files and, additionally, specific TRE files native to Afterlife, are distributed through our launcher utility.

Disclaimer:  Portions of the EmuYoda application will break this VM.   I do not suggest using them for Afterlife.

We will not provide support for anyone who creates their own server based on this work.
